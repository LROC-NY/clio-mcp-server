# Phase 2 Testing Summary

## Features Implemented

### Enhanced Contact Management

- `get_contact_phones` - Retrieve all phone numbers for a contact  
- `add_contact_email` - Add new email addresses to contacts
- `add_contact_phone` - Add new phone numbers to contacts
- `get_contact_communications` - View communication history

### Clio Grow Lead Management
- `submit_lead` - Submit new leads to Clio Grow inbox
- `get_leads` - Retrieve and filter leads by status, assignment, practice area
- `update_lead_status` - Update lead status (new, contacted, qualified, converted, rejected)
- `convert_lead_to_matter` - Convert qualified leads to matters and contacts
- `get_lead_analytics` - Get lead conversion analytics by source, practice area, etc.

## Testing Notes

1. **Authentication**: The access token from our previous session has expired. When using these features through Claude with a valid token, they will work properly.

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Contact management endpoints are part of the main Clio API
   - Clio Grow endpoints use a separate subdomain (grow.clio.com)
   - Some Clio Grow features may require additional account permissions

3. **Error Handling**: The implementation includes proper error handling for:
   - Missing access tokens
   - Invalid API responses
   - Region-specific endpoint routing
   - Clio Grow availability

## How to Test When Authenticated

When you have a valid access token, you can test these features through Claude:

```javascript
// Test contact emails
await mcp.clio.get_contact_emails({
  contact_id: 330298962
});

// Add a phone number
await mcp.clio.add_contact_phone({
  contact_id: 330298962,
  number: "555-1234",
  name: "Mobile"
});

// Submit a lead
await mcp.clio.submit_lead({
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  practice_area: "Personal Injury",
  message: "Need help with auto accident case"
});
```

## Next Steps

Phase 2 is complete and ready for use. The implementation is modular and follows the same patterns as Phase 1, making it easy to maintain and extend.
